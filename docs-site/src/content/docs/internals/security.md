This page is the honest version of what Pooled does and does not protect. Read it before you run a room with anyone you would not hand a shared document link to.

:::caution[The short version]
Everyone in a room can read your prompts. Run rooms with people you trust, not strangers.

## How a room works, for security purposes

The browsers in a room split one model's layers and pass its intermediate activations (the "hidden state") to each other over direct WebRTC connections. Only the **host** turns hidden states into text: it holds the tokenizer, embedding, LM head and sampler. The **signaling server** only introduces browsers and carries no model traffic.

## What the design gives you

- **No counterparty.** There is no account, no API key, and no server that sees your conversation.
- **Transport encryption.** WebRTC data channels are encrypted with DTLS on every hop, and each link proves it is the one the two ends think it is (below), so the signaling server can't sit in the middle of it.
- **Each device loads only its own layers**, from the public model repository or from another device in the room.
- **You choose who sees the chat.** The room is a shared conversation by design, and everyone sees questions and answers on their own screen. The host can limit that:

  **Room settings → Who sees the chat**: **Everyone** (default), **Only me** (the host) or **Whoever asked**. Every device still computes the answer; this only decides which screens get the text.

## What it cannot promise

- **Hidden states are not encryption.** The hidden state that crosses each hop is a lossy transformation of your text. Published attacks reconstruct a large fraction of tokens from mid-model activations (for example [arXiv 2503.09022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09022)). So the visibility setting hides text from screens, not from a determined peer that holds layers. **Assume anyone in your room can read your prompts.**
- **Remote compute is not verified.** A peer could return wrong or manipulated activations. Nothing in the current design detects this. Spot-check auditing is on the roadmap.
- **Weights shared inside the room are not verified either.** A device missing a byte range can take it from another device that has it cached, and only the length is checked. A malicious peer could hand out altered weights. That is the same trust a room already places in its peers' compute. `?peerweights=0` turns sharing off and fetches everything from the model repository.
- **Peers learn metadata** beyond the transcript: device names, memory pledges, layer assignments and timing, through the room roster.
- **Peers see your IP address**, as with any direct WebRTC connection. `?relay=1` with a [TURN relay](/docs/self-host/turn) sends all of a device's traffic through the relay so other devices never see its address.

Noise or permutation "privacy" tricks are not used on purpose. They are known to be breakable and would give a false sense of safety. For the same reason Pooled does not open rooms to strangers by default, and does not claim to be private, end-to-end encrypted or verified.

## Who is on a link

A room finds its devices through a **signaling server**: the public PeerJS cloud (`0.peerjs.com`, run by a third party) unless you [run your own](/docs/self-host/signaling). Signaling carries each link's offer and answer, and those name the certificates the encrypted link is checked against. A signaling server that rewrote them could put itself in the middle of a link and pass everything along. A TURN relay can't do this; it only forwards encrypted packets.

So Pooled never sends a secret over a link as is:

- **The invite key and passes are proved, not sent.** A joining device proves it holds the key (or the pass the host gave it) with a cryptographic proof tied to the exact link it is on: both ends' certificates, both device ids and a fresh random number from each side. The host proves the key back, so a fake host learns nothing and gets nothing it can replay. A proof made on a link someone sits in the middle of is worth nothing on the other half, so the host doesn't let that device in, and the device leaves a "host" that can't prove itself.
- **The host keeps no plaintext pass.** It keeps each pass's SHA-256 hash, and the proof uses that hash. Someone who could read the host's saved room could use those hashes, but that same saved room already holds the invite key itself.
- **Links between devices prove the room's key.** Every device the host lets in gets a room key. Links between devices, and the extra links the hidden state uses, prove it before they carry anything, so a stranger who dials a device, or someone in the middle of such a link, is closed out.

**Allow is trust on first use.** A device that typed the code has nothing to prove. When you press Allow, you trust that link. To check it, compare the six-digit code on your prompt (and in `pooled host`'s lobby line) with the one on the joining device's waiting screen. If they match, nobody is in the middle. Checking is optional.

**A room that doesn't ask** (**Ask before new devices join** off, `pooled host --allow-all`, or a room node made without the gate) lets in anyone with the code, which includes whoever runs signaling.

**Older Pooled versions.** For one release, a host still accepts the raw invite key from a device that runs an older Pooled, and a new device still sends it to an older host. Both warn ("runs an older Pooled … update"). Until both ends update, someone in the middle of signaling can still pretend to be the older side and read the key. `?legacyauth=0` on the page, or `POOLED_LEGACY_AUTH=0` for the CLI and the OpenClaw plugin, turns this off now. The next release turns it off by default.

## The Serve API

`pooled serve` runs on your own computer and joins the room as an ask-only guest.

- It listens on `127.0.0.1` only. Set `POOLED_TOKEN` to require a key as well.
- Prompts sent through it go to the room's host and, unless the host limits visibility, to everyone in the room. The same rules as the chat apply.
- The host can switch API clients off, or disconnect one.

See [CLI options and security](/docs/serve/options).

## Code mode

In Code mode the room's model writes a small web app and runs it. That code is written by a model, so treat it as untrusted.

- **Files live on the host.** The project is in the host's browser storage, or in a folder on disk the host picked. Other devices get a read-only copy of the files and can choose to run the preview themselves.
- **The preview is a sandboxed frame.** It gets an opaque origin and `allow-scripts` only: no access to the room's storage, cookies, cached weights or page; no popups; no top-level navigation; no camera or microphone. A content security policy blocks network requests except to two public script CDNs. Messages from the frame are shown as plain text.
- **Peers check what they receive.** Preview files from the host are checked against their SHA-256 hashes and against the limits (400 files, 2 MB each, 8 MB in all) before a peer uses them. Timeline text is typed, capped and shown as plain text.
- **Edits to a real folder need approval.** Every edit shows a diff and waits for the host to approve it, unless the host allows edits for the current task. Scratch projects in browser storage apply edits without asking, and still show the diff.

### The preview origin

Without a separate preview origin, the preview runs in the same process as the room tab. A preview that loops forever can freeze the room.

A deployment can set `<meta name="preview-origin">` to a second site on another registrable domain. Previews then run there, in a separate process, and only then may the agent run code snippets (`run_js`). A preview origin on the page's own site (a subdomain), or plain http from an https page, is ignored, because it could not isolate the preview.

:::note
The preview origin is not turned on for pooled.run yet ([roadmap 29](https://github.com/Nehanth/pooled/tree/main/roadmap)). Until it is, `run_js` is off there.

## Model weights and supply chain

- Each browser downloads weights directly from public Hugging Face repositories over HTTPS, and caches them in the browser's Cache API. Pooled ships no weights.
- The exact file a room runs is identified by its URL and size stamp. Checking a content hash against the upstream repository is planned (roadmap 19).
- pooled.run is static files. No code runs on a server.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Email **nehanthnarendrula@gmail.com** with "Pooled security" in the subject. Include steps to reproduce and the browser and OS. You will get an acknowledgement within 72 hours. Please don't open a public issue until a fix is available.

Activation inversion and unverified peers are known limits of the design, described above, not vulnerabilities. Discussion of them is welcome in [public issues](https://github.com/Nehanth/pooled/issues).
