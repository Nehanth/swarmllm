# Bench log

Every kernel/engine change gets a row. All 27B numbers are Qwen 3.8 27B Q4_0,
greedy, bit-identical output verified by the test suite (`test_mtp_deno.js`,
`test_batch_*_deno.js`). GB10 = DGX Spark via Deno/wgpu (Vulkan, no subgroups,
shader-f16 available). Mac = user's MacBook, Chrome, staging site.

| Date | Change | Commit | GB10 decode plain | GB10 decode spec K=3 | GB10 spec K=7 | GB10 prefill (batched) | Mac decode | Mac prefill | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Aug 29 | Launch state | main | 3.6 | — | — | 3.0 | 2.5 | ~3 | one thread per row, f32 scales |
| Aug 31 | Coop kernels + batched prefill + fusion + f16 scales | 71b7b85..9f8b852 | 9.0 | — | — | 15.2 (4-col) | 6.7 | 14–16 | |
| Sep 1 | Multi-column batched ops (2x batched passes) | f1a87a9 | 9.1 | — | — | 39.4 | | | |
| Sep 1 | MTP self-speculation | e8d5642, 15c389f | 9.07 | 15.86 (85% acc) | — | 39.4 | 10–10.8 | 12 s/prompt | cross-network 3.5–4 tok/s |
| Sep 1 | Adaptive deep speculation (K=3/5/7 by lap RTT) | 3461d10 | 8.72–9.14 | 16.07 (85%) | 13.09 (71%, 6.0 tok/lap) | 39.4 | | | K=7 only chosen when lap >260 ms |
| Sep 1 | GPU argmax for the draft chain (8-byte readback instead of 1 MB/draft) | — | 9.06 / 8.85 | 16.13 (85%) | 12.32 (71%) | | | | neutral on GB10 (unified memory); helps discrete GPUs |
| Sep 1 | 8-wide batched columns (BCOLS=8) — prefill | — | 8.7–9.0 | | | 27.3 (4w) vs 26.1 (8w×2r) vs 27.9 (8w×4r), 86-tok prompt | | | no gain: 8-col pass ≈ 4-col pass ⇒ prefill is bound by the serial DeltaNet recurrence, not GEMV |
| Sep 1 | **Native reference: llama.cpp CUDA (build 749f688), same GGUF** | — | **7.99** (tg32) | — | — | **377** (pp86) | | | WebGPU beats native on decode (9.0 plain); prefill 14x behind ⇒ parallel recurrence is the prize |
| Sep 1 | Deep spec with single 8-col verify (BCOLS=8) | e07c0e0 | 8.68 | | K=7: 14.86 (71%); K=5: 16.65 (97%, partly contaminated) | | | | K=7 never pays solo; K=5 is the candidate |
| Sep 1 | unpack4xU8/I8 dequant in all coop kernels (probe-gated fallback) | — | 8.65 | | | 26.0 | | | bit-exact; neutral on GB10 (driver already optimized the shifts) — kept for Metal/Android where ALU is scarcer |
| Sep 1 | Bandwidth probe: achievable streaming read on GB10 via WebGPU = 184 GB/s | — | | | | | | | decode GEMVs = 15 GB / 82 ms = 183 GB/s ⇒ AT roofline; remaining decode cost is ~30 ms of small-dispatch overhead |
| Sep 2 | Accumulate matvecs (y += W·x): residual adds folded in, −192 dispatches/token | — | 8.93 | 15.64 (85%) | | 25.8 | | | bit-exact; neutral on GB10 ⇒ small dispatches are ~free on Vulkan; kept for Metal |
| Sep 2 | Gates+L2 fused (dn_pre), room at 8 cols × 2 rows, 4-col twin kernels, 2-D dispatch for tall matvecs | — | 8.8–9.2 | 15.49 (85%, room cfg) | K=5: 16.02 (97%, room cfg); K=5 @ 8×4 rows: 17.00 | 42.8 (18-tok test) | | | bug fixed: LM head at 2 rows/WG = 124k workgroups > 65535 limit, dispatch silently dropped |
| Sep 2 | GEMM prototype for prefill (bench_gemm_deno.js): 16-col tiled Q4 GEMM, vec4 shared tiles, 2×4 thread tile | — | | | | 17408×5120 × 16 cols: gemm 1.83 ms vs coop_b 4×4-col 1.93 ms (parity) | | | correct (2.5e-7); only 27 GB/s / 1.5 TFLOPS ⇒ latency-bound (2 barriers × 160 k-blocks, loads exposed). Next: register prefetch of block b+1, 64-k steps, 2+ WGs/SM |
