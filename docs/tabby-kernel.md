# Tabby kernel: the engine side of a P2P coding harness

`tabby-kernel` turns the SwarmLLM engine (Qwen 3.8 27B across browser tabs) into something a
coding agent can sit on: long context, sessions that resume without re-prefilling, a disk cache,
and tool calls. Research behind the choices: [research/tabby-2026-09.md](research/tabby-2026-09.md);
earlier kernel work: [research/kernels-2026-09.md](research/kernels-2026-09.md).

Nothing here has been timed on a real GPU yet (the development machine only has SwiftShader).
Every change is either bit-identical to what it replaces or checked against it by a test, and
each has a switch for A/B timing on real hardware.

## Long context: f16 KV cache + split-K flash attention

| | before | now |
|---|---|---|
| KV cache | f32, 131 KB per token (whole 27B) | f16, 65.5 KB per token |
| attention | scores → softmax → out, whole row per head; the fast softmax stops at 2048 | `attn_flash` + `attn_combine`: splits of 256 positions, the 6 query heads that share a KV head read each K/V row once, online softmax, fixed-order merge |
| room context (27B) | 2048 tokens | 8192 tokens (0.54 GB of KV for the whole model, split over the devices) |

- Batched passes (prefill, verify) use `attn_flash_t2`: two columns per workgroup, each K/V row
  read once for both, same bits as the one-column kernel (`attnTile: false` to compare).
- `kv_store` writes the new K/V rows as packed f16 pairs in one dispatch (it replaces two
  buffer copies per column).
- The same kernels serve decode (1 column) and verify / prefill (many columns), and all their
  orders are fixed by absolute position, so speculative decoding stays exactly plain decoding and
  a split room stays exactly one device (engine_synth, room_synth).
- f16 K/V is not bit-identical to the old f32 path: `tests/e2e/flash_synth.mjs` compares the two
  (same greedy tokens; logit differences at 1e-6 of the logit range, also on a 2300-token prompt
  past the old 2048 limit, and at the 27B's shapes).
- Switch: `Qwen35Engine.create({ attnFlash: false })` restores the f32 path.
- int8 KV (`kvQ8: true`, room `?kv=q8`): one f32 scale per 32 values, `kv_store_q8` /
  `attn_flash_q8` from the same template as the f16 kernel. 36 KB per token for the whole 27B.
  Opt-in until someone checks long-document quality on the real model.
- Any `maxSeq` works; the split length grows past 32K so a head never has more than 128 splits.
  Memory at 32K: 2.1 GB of KV for the whole model in f16, 1.2 GB in int8 (q4 KV is not
  recommended: it hurts long documents and tool calls, research §3).

## Sessions: save, restore, rewind, share a prefix

`engine/qwen35.js`:

- `exportState()` → `{ sig, pos, parts }`: this device's KV rows `[0, pos)`, DeltaNet states and
  conv windows, the draft block's KV, and the trunk hidden the next draft starts from. Read back
  one part at a time, so a long context never needs one huge mapping.
- `importState(state)`: refuses a state for other layers, another model or KV format
  (`stateSignature()`).
- `saveSlot(name)` / `loadSlot(name)` / `dropSlot(name)`: the same, as GPU-to-GPU copies, for
  switching sessions or rewinding an agent to an earlier turn.

A hybrid model cannot be cut back to an arbitrary position (the DeltaNet state is a running sum),
so reuse works at checkpoints: after the system prompt + tools, and after every finished turn.
`harness/prefix.js` (`PrefixIndex`) picks the longest checkpoint that is a prefix of the new
prompt; only the rest is prefilled. Coding agents resend ~96% of their input every turn
(research §3), which is what this saves.

`tests/e2e/state_synth.mjs`: restore after a reset and a different prompt, GPU slots, speculative
decoding after a restore, and an OPFS round trip all resume with bit-identical logits.

Size of a state on the 27B: ~150 MiB of DeltaNet state (fixed) + 65.5 KB per token of KV, for the
whole model; each device only holds its own layers' share.

### Across a split room (`?ckpt=N`, default 2)

After every answer the host saves the room's state on every device: a `sv` key rides on the next
frame down the chain, like reset and rollback do, so each device saves its own layers at exactly
the same point. A regenerate, an edited question or a branch then resumes from the longest saved
answer (`ld` key on the first frame) and prefills only what is new; the status line says
"(N reused)". Old checkpoints are dropped (`dp`) past N; a device rejoining with a fresh engine,
a re-deal or a failed answer clears them. Order on a device: rollback, save, drop, reset, load.
`tests/e2e/room_synth.mjs --regen --expect-reuse` checks that a regenerate over 3 devices resumes
from a checkpoint and repeats the greedy answer. `?ckpt=0` turns it off.

### Several sessions on one engine

`harness/sessions.js` (`Sessions`): `switchTo(id)` parks the current conversation in a GPU slot
and brings `id` back from a GPU slot, from disk, or starts it fresh. Past `gpuSlots` parked
sessions, the least recently used go to OPFS (`exportSlot`, no switch needed); `persist()` saves
the active one; `close(id)` forgets one. Switching is exact: `tests/e2e/sessions_synth.mjs`
interleaves three sessions with one spare slot (one goes to disk and back) and compares every
logit with the same sessions decoded uninterrupted. This is time-sharing: one session computes at
a time. Batching several sessions through one pass is still on the list.

## Disk cache (OPFS)

`harness/statecache.js` (`StateCache`, `tokenKey`): states on the browser's origin-private file
system, keyed by SHA-256 of (model, this device's layer range and KV format, token ids). Temp file
+ rename, so a crash never leaves a half state under a real key; least recently used entries go
past a byte budget (8 GB default). In a room every device stores its own part under the same key;
the host asks everyone to load it and prefills instead if anyone is missing theirs.

Not done: SSD weight streaming. The research looked at Edge0 (the @SamuelZengML post: MoE experts
streamed from flash with a learned prefetcher) and SSD expert streaming on a Mac mini (the
@thefp4brain thread): both rely on MoE sparsity. A dense 27B touches every weight every token, so
streaming would pin decode to disk bandwidth; splitting the layers over peers is the answer here.

## Tool calls

`harness/tools.js`:
- `detectStyle(chatTemplate)`: "xml" (Qwen3-Coder / 3.5 / 3.8: `<function=…><parameter=…>`) or
  "json" (Qwen3 Hermes-style), read from the GGUF's own template.
- `toolsSystemPrompt(tools, { style, system })`, `toolResponses(results)` (one user turn of
  `<tool_response>` blocks), `renderCalls(calls, style)`.
- `ToolCallParser`: streaming; shows text as it comes but never half a tag, returns calls as they
  complete, accepts both formats, tolerates a missing `</parameter>` or `</tool_call>` at the end,
  converts XML parameter text to the schema's types.

`harness/constrain.js` (`ToolCallConstraint`): inside a tool call, masks the logits so the
function name and parameter names can only be declared ones; free text everywhere else. One
vocabulary scan per state, cached.

Unit tests: `tests/unit/tools_test.js`, `constrain_test.js`, `prefix_test.js`.

## Also in this branch

- The kernels branch work: fused attention glue, fused DeltaNet delta + gated norm, batched
  attention for verify / prefill (all bit-identical), register-resident DeltaNet, Q8 prefill GEMM,
  replay rollback, batched draft-cache fill, the multi-device gibberish fixes.
- Prompt-lookup drafts search the whole context (16K window, was 4K): code edits copy from
  anywhere in the files the agent has read.

## Next

1. Time it on two Macs and a GB10: decode tok/s at 1K / 8K context, prefill tok/s, `?fuse=0`.
2. Persist room checkpoints to OPFS on every device (the engine and store are there; the room
   keeps them on the GPU today), so a session survives a reload.
3. Stable prompt rendering for agents: never drop old turns (it breaks reuse); compact instead.
4. Several sessions at once: per-session KV / state slots batched through one pass.
5. Pipelined speculative windows across devices (Mesh-LLM keeps several verifies in flight).
6. Suffix / n-gram drafting chained after the MTP drafts (Mesh-LLM: +156% on code-copy loads).
7. q8 KV for 32K-64K; a tiled prefill attention kernel for long prompts.
